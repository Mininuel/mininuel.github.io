## Featured Work and Research Experience

### High Traffic Recipe Prediction
A machine learning project focused on predicting whether a recipe will attract
high website traffic using historical engagement data.

**Tools used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
**Key outcome**: Achieved over 80 percent classification accuracy

### Butyrate Production Optimization
Data-driven optimization of a biological fermentation process for butyrate
production using regression modeling and experimental data analysis.

**Model performance**:  
- R-squared value of 0.856  
- Root mean square error of 0.308 g/L  

**Process outcome**:  
- Optimized conditions led to approximately 40 percent increase in butyrate
  yield compared with the baseline process  

This work demonstrates the application of data science techniques to biological
process optimization and bioprocess performance improvement.

(Project repository will be added.)
